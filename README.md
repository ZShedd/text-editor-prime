## Description

This is a text editor that runs in the browser.  It's a single-page application that meets the Progressive Web Applications (PWA) criteria.  It will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser.  The application will also function offline.

This application will use a package idb, which is a lightweight wrapper around the IndexedDB API.
